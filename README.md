# AdpulseAndroidApp
Adpulse aims to provide ad agencies with an effective and efficient system to track the locations they’ve visited, and update information on the ads they’ve changed. Additionally, it allows all user changes to be published to a separate service where it will save the data allowing company management to process it.
